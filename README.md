# hello-world
New programmer interested in research applications and data, with a background in neuroscience/psychology and art (photography and circus performance). Based in Texas with aspirations to move to Portland, OR, Colorado or somewhere outside of the US. I love dance of every kind, but started with swing, then moved to samba and now focus on aerial silks (aka fabric or ribbon). I spendt 6 months in Brazil after college and it was amazing.
