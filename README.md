# hello-world
New programmer interested in research applications and data, with a background in neuroscience/psychology and art (photography and circus performance). Based in Texas with aspirations to move to the West Coast, Colorado or somewhere outside of the US. I love every kind of dance, but started with Swing, then moved to Samba and now focus on Aerial Silks (aka fabric or ribbon). I spent 6 months in Brazil after college, teaching English, and it was amazing.
